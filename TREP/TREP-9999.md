TREP:
Title: Sample TREP template
Author: degrown
Discussions-To: https://github.com/thinkingrock-gtd/tr-discuss-governance/discussions/32
Status: Draft
Created: 


## Abstract

This TREP provides a boilerplate or sample template for creating your own TREPs.
In conjunction with the content guidelines in [TREP 1](/TREP/TREP-1.md), this should make it easy for you to conform your own TREPs to the format outlined below.

Note: if you are reading this TREP via the web, do not use the HTML file as your template!
Instead, you should grab the text source of this TREP from the TREPs repository.

## Motivation

Having no approved template for a TREP it's time consuming for both the author and the TR core team.
Also, this make a contribution barrier to every author who'd like to help the project. 


## Rationale

If you intend to submit a TREP, you MUST use this template, in conjunction with the format guidelines below, to ensure that your TREP submission won’t get rejected because of form.

## Specification

This template is heavily borrowed from the template created by the Python language community, PEP 12[^1].

### TREP Header Preamble

Each TREP must begin with header preamble. The headers must appear in the following order. Headers marked with “*” are optional and are described below. All other headers are required.

```
  TREP: <trep number>
  Title: <trep title>
  Author: <list of authors' usernames and optionally, real names and email addresses>
* Sponsor: <sponsor username and optionally, real name and email address>
  Discussions-To: <URLs of discussion threads>
  Status: <Draft | Active | Accepted | Deferred | Rejected |
           Withdrawn | Final | Superseded>
* Requires: <trep numbers>
  Created: <date created on, in yyyy-mm-dd format>
* Replaces: <trep number>
* Superseded-By: <trep number>
```

The Author header lists the usernames, and optionally the real names and email addresses of all the authors/owners of the TREP. The format of the Author header values must be:

accountname - Random J. User random@example.com

If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line.

The Sponsor field records which TR core member is sponsoring the TREP. If one of the authors of the TREP is a TR core member, then no sponsor is necessary and thus this field should be left out.

The Discussions-To header provides the URLs to the discussion threads for the TREP.

The Created header records the date that the TREP was assigned a number; should be in yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2023-03-26.

TREPs may have a Requires header, indicating the TREP numbers that this TREP depends on.

TREPs may also have a Superseded-By header indicating that a TREP has been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the TREP that replaces the current document. The newer TREP must have a Replaces header containing the number of the TREP that it rendered obsolete.

### How to Use This Template

- Make a copy of this file (the .md file, not the HTML!) and perform the following edits. Name the new file trep-9999.md if you don’t yet have a TREP number assignment, or trep-NNNN.md if you do. Those with push permissions are welcome to claim the next available number and push it directly.
- Replace the “TREP: 7” header with “TREP: 9999” or “TREP: NNNN”, matching the file name. Note that the file name should be padded with zeros (eg trep-0012.md), but the header should not (TREP: 12).
- Change the Title header to the title of your TREP.
- Change the Author header to include your username, and optionally your name and email address. It is okay to obfuscate your email address.
- If none of the authors are in the TR core team, include a Sponsor header with the name of the core member sponsoring your TREP.
- Add the direct URL of the TREP’s canonical discussion thread (on tr-discuss-governance) under the Discussions-To header. If the thread will be created after the TREP is submitted as an official draft, it is okay to just list the venue name initially, but remember to update the TREP with the URL as soon as the TREP is successfully merged to the TREPs repository and you create the corresponding discussion thread. See TREP 1 for more details.
- Change the Status header to “Draft”.
- If your TREP depends on the acceptance of some other currently in-development TREP, add a Requires header right after the Status header. The value should be the TREP number of the TREP yours depends on. Don’t add this header if your dependent feature is described in a Final TREP.
- Change the Created header to today’s date. Be sure to follow the format carefully: it must be in yyyy-mm-dd format.
- Add a Replaces header if your TREP obsoletes an earlier TREP. The value of this header is the number of the TREP that your new TREP is replacing. Only add this header if the older TREP is in “final” form, i.e. is either Accepted, Final, or Rejected. You aren’t replacing an older open TREP if you’re submitting a competing idea.
- Now write your Abstract, Rationale, and other content for your TREP, replacing all this sample text with your own text. Be sure to adhere to the format guidelines below. See “TREP Sections” below for a template of sections to include.
- Update your Footnotes section, listing any footnotes and non-inline link targets referenced by the text.
- Create a pull request against the TREPs repository.

### TREP Sections

Various sections are found to be common across TREPs and are outlined above. Those sections are provided here for convenience.

Below you can find a complete structure of a TREP; whenever a section isn't used, please mantain the section title, with no content.

```
TREP: <REQUIRED: trep number>
Title: <REQUIRED: trep title>
Author: <REQUIRED: list of authors' usernames and optionally, real names and email addresses>
Sponsor: <sponsor username and optionally, real name and email address of sponsor>
Discussions-To: <REQUIRED: URLs of discussion threads>
Status: <REQUIRED: Draft | Active | Accepted | Deferred | Rejected | Withdrawn | Final | Superseded>
Requires: <trep numbers>
Created: <date created on, in yyyy-mm-dd format>
Replaces: <trep number>
Superseded-By: <trep number>
