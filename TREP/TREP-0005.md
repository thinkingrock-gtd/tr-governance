## Abstract

This document specifies the guidelines regarding the usage of project management tools by all project on the ThinkingRock organization.


## Motivation

Without a shared approach about this usage, we'll reach a disomogeneous setup among the different projects.
Because of that, there will be some organizational entropy regarding roles, visibility and deadlines. 


## Rationale

The approach to project management has to be simple (for easy handling), transparent (respecting the opensource spirit of the ThinkingRock organization) and consistent (among projects and repos).


## Specification

As of now, the ThinkingRock organization is using the GitHub platform, both for code hosting and for organizational purposes.
During the period in which GitHub is used for these areas of activities, these are the project management guidelines for every project in the organization: 

- all the activities will be tracked on the GitHub features called "Projects" (from now on: "project boards", for clarity)
- all the issues will surface on these projects boards
- all the project boards will have public visibility
- on all the project boards there will be "standard" statuses; we can change them, but we must try to be uniform
- we'll set up automation regarding status changes during the issue lifetime
- when using the project board as a Kanban board, we can define a maximum number of items in every column
