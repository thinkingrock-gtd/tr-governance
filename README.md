## About tr-discuss-governance repository
Here you won't find code related to any project included into the ThinkingRock organization (from now on: TR).

Instead, here we'll share approved final documentation about various matters of the TR project ...like:
- agreements about code (best practices, general choices, etc) 
- agreements about organization/responsibility/principles/behaviour, etc
- documentation, also about single project, that we think that don't has to be public, at least for the time being
- etc..

### Content structure
Other than few general files, all the content will be grouped in directories. In detail:
- TREP: here you'll find the "ThinkingRock Evolution Proposals" (like Java and Python projects are doing); you can look at TREP-0 to find the proposal list
